###  Human Trafficking Recognition from Escort Ads and Inter-Ad Matching
- **(Team Lead)** designed the machine learning pipeline architecture and set up data annotation pipeline
-  implemented similar image search with custom contrastive loss, trained models for image-based and text-based
trafficking recognition, NER-based social handle extraction

### Analysis of Radio Panelists Data
- **(Team Lead)** conducted analysis on the effect of song quality, commercial length and part of the day in the
panelists with custom metrics, and statistical tests to identify quality of songs
- prepared data pipeline to curate and add additional features in the dumped data

### Action Recognition Project
- built custom object detection architecture by fusing SSD, mobilenet architecture and focal loss, and fused across
frames to identify the type of waste and the intent of the person to throw in the dustbin

### Session-based Network Intrusion Detection System
- feasibility test on the use of AutoEncoder-based semi-supervised learning for network anomaly detection using
session data from pcap files

### Nepali License Plate Recognition
- designed and implemented license plate recognition system targeted for Nepali license plates, involving three
models - vehicle detection, license plate localization (ResNet-18), and a Nepali character-based OCR
- created a license plate localization dataset for Nepali license plates by manually annotating 8000 vehicle images
and a Nepali character classification dataset by extracting alphabets and numbers from Devanagiri fonts
